2D flock simulation based on boids in Julia and Makie. Made for a
biophysics course.  To refactor eventually. Now there're some things
copy-pasted around.  Very barebones, was run from CLI therefore no
interactive parameter manipulation.  For a different take check
Agents.jl package which has a predefined Flock model.
